Product Purchasing Web Application
**********************************

Employment application programming assignment.


Project Architecture
====================
Project consists of two services; user facing WebGUI, backend data updater:

| User -> WebGUI <-> ProductAPI
|               \<-> Persistent Store

| Product Updater <- ProductAPI
|                 ->  Persistent Store


ProductAPI
----------

3rd party REST API. Source of Product information. Processor of Product
purchases.  Accessed with requests HTTP library.


WebGUI
-------

Displays product data to user. Receives product purchase requests from user.
Proxies purchases to ProductAPI and locally stores purchase information.

Django


Persistent Store
----------------

Nothing in requirements suggests needs beyond traditional relational database.
Development / Demo using SQLite database. Production system would deploy
PostgreSQL.


Product Updater
---------------
Pulls product data from ProductAPI and stuffs it into Persistent Store.
"Buffering" the latency and downtime of Product List API call

Due to regular periodic schedule of product updates (1/mo) the simpleist
system is cron job. For other use cases a full blown asynchronous task
queue/runner might be needed. Such as http://python-rq.org/ or
http://www.celeryproject.org/


Data Schema
===========


Product
-------
From product list API call.
  - Product ID         ; Foreign (assigned by API).
  - <details>

  - FK_Product ID
  - Product Name
  - Product Price
  - Quantity Ordered
  - Confirmation Code   ; From purchase API call.

Directory Structure
===================


Assignment
==========
Create a Web App consisting of four (4) customer facing views:

  1. Product Listing
  2. Product Detail
  3. Product Purchase
  4. Purchase Complete


1 - Product Listing
-------------------

Displays a list of products along with pricing information for each product.
Each product will link to a product detail page.

The list of products is available via API GET request::

  https://careers.undercovertourist.com/assignment/1/products/

Functional requirements/notes:

  - Refer to the Authentication section below for access rights
  - The list of products is updated the first of every month.
  - The list of products can potentially have a slow response time (5+
    seconds) depending on system load (purchase API will always respond
    quickly).
  - The list of products API request could potentially be unavailable from
    midnight through 6am every day (purchase API will still be available).


2 - Product Detail
------------------

Displays the details of the product along with a purchase option if the
product has inventory.

Each product detail is available via API GET request::

  https://careers.undercovertourist.com/assignment/1/products/XXX/

Where XXX is replaced with the appropriate product id.

Functional requirements/notes:

  - Refer to the Authentication section below for access rights
  - inventory_on_hand should be checked upon page load and the purchase option only
    displayed if the product is available (inventory_on_hand > 0).
  - The purchase option will take you to the Product Purchase page.


3 - Product Purchase
--------------------

Provide a form to collect Customer Details and purchase the product by
POSTING the correct information to the API.

Save the customer details, purchased product details and response from the
API to web app storage.

Submit a purchase request via API POST::

  https://careers.undercovertourist.com/assignment/1/products/XXX/purchase/

Where XXX is replaced with the appropriate product id
Refer to the Authentication section below for access rights

Example POST payload::

  {
  "customer_email": "sally_baker@undercovertourist.com",
  "customer_name": "Sally Baker",
  "customer_phone": "(512) 555-1234",
  "quantity": 2
  }

Store the following data for each purchase:

  - Confirmation Code (confirmation_code)
  - Product Name
  - Product Price
  - Customer Name
  - Customer Email Address
  - Customer Phone Number


4 - Purchase Complete
---------------------

This landing page will show the customer whether the purchase was successful
or not.


Authentication
--------------

For every call to the API you should set the X-AUTH header using your first
and last name separated by period::

  {firstname}.{lastname}


FAQS
====
What framework/language should I use?

  Whatever you are most comfortable and can develop most quickly.

What should the pages look like?

  We would like the pages to look presentable but we do not expect you to
  spend a lot of time on layout. Programmer styling is okay, it doesnâ€™t need
  to look pretty!

What is the format of the API responses?

  JSON
